# Overview

[**Ingress**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) An API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP. Ingress may provide load balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting.

[**Ingress Controllers**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) In order for the Ingress resource to work, the cluster must have an ingress controller running. Unlike other types of controllers which run as part of the kube-controller-manager binary, Ingress controllers are not started automatically with a cluster. Use this page to choose the ingress controller implementation that best fits your cluster.
