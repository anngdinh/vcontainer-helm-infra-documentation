### Young people are now spending more and more time and money following fashion trends. Is this a positive or negative development?

> Admittedly, there are several advantages to spending a lot of time and money following fashion trends related to quality of life and creation in work. For some people who have a passion for fashion, updating the latest trends every day helps them become more confident, which becomes a kind of entertainment for a large part of the young generation nowadays. This is because these newest models usually help their owners feel that they are the most attractive ones among the crowd, making these people produce more happiness hormones in their brains when they wear them. Additionally, these works of art are usually creative with strange shapes or have eye-catching looks, inspiring a lot of people, especially those who work in the art field. With them, creation is the most important thing and they are willing to pay any price as long as it can bring more creativity and productivity to their work.

> On the other hand, trying to own the latest fashion trends is having potential drawbacks for many people, especially the young generation. These good-looking items just have temporary value for their owners' appearance, which will be outdated soon when the trend is over. When the time has come, they are no more than normal things, which causes a big loss. Furthermore, spending a lot of time and money on fashion will make you lose the opportunity to invest in the things that make people more valuable in today's life. These resources are supposed to be used to learn new knowledge and practice necessary skills, which are more useful and long-term valuable than a good-looking appearance.

### Employers should give longer holidays to employees to encourage them to do their job well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

`
Opinions are divided on whether employers should give longer holidays to employees to encourage them to do their job well or not. Although it may bring about certain negative impacts, the benefits outweigh them.

Admittedly, giving longer holidays to employees may be disadvantageous in a few different ways related to short-term performance and increasing workload when returning. Regarding the former, a longer holiday almost certainly causes delays in short-term plans. This is because the frequency of absence of staff will make the current project slow down, which will even slow down others who work with them. With regard to the latter, a huge stack workload, the result after many days of holidays may cause not a little pressure and stress. Then they have to work more and more to catch up with the plans, so these long breaks are not bringing about effective or even counterproductive.

On the other hand, the benefits of extended breaks far outweigh the drawbacks to employees. Firstly, longer holidays can offer they more options such as a long journey to a foreign country or many days of healing in a mountain, which is usually limited by short breaks. These new experiences offer many benefits such as releasing stress and increasing mental and physical health, which results in more productivity. Secondly, this policy brings about the feeling of job satisfaction, and the balance between life and work, making them want a long-term commitment, reducing the cost when employers have to recruit and train new staff.

In conclusion, the benefits of giving longer holidays to employees outweigh its potential drawbacks. Based on the aforementioned arguments, I completely agree with the proposed idea.

### People nowadays sleep less than they used to in the past. What do you think is the reason for this? What are the effects of this habit?

- Reason:
  - The development of technology make people connected than ever before
  - The increasing pressure of life - work harder and longer hours - less time to sleep
  - abuse of stimulants such as coffee, alcohol, energy drinks

`
Nowadays, it's increasingly common for people to sleep less than they used to in the past. This tendency is the result of several factors, which could lead to many negative impacts.

There are several factors bringing about this tendency in today's society.

### Goverments should spend money on railways rather than roads. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

- Agree:
  - Safer + example
  - environmentally friendly + example

> Opinions are divided on whether governments should spend money on railways rather than roads or not. Although it may bring about certain negative impacts, the benefits outweigh them.
>
> Admittedly, spending money on railways may be disadvantageous in a few different ways related to wasted resources and ability to utilize. Regarding the former,

- Partial Agreement

`

In conclusion, while both railways and roads are important, I think governments should prioritize railways because they are better for the environment and can solve issues like traffic congestion in urban areas. At the same time, maintaining roads for local transportation is also essential.
